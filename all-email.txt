    some tipps about sending email

        Hello 比 Hi正式。Dear最正式。想象你和对方见面一定要西装革履打领带，
            就说Dear Mr. X, Dear Ms. X, Dear Hiring Manager（你不知对方名字只知道职位情况下）
        你和对方见面穿衬衫西裤，不打领带，就可以说Hello John，Hello Mary，
        你和对方见面T恤仔裤就可以，就说Hi John，Hi Mary，如果你和对方穿着背心也可以见面，就写Hey John好了。

        一般化的邮件或者需要传达快乐的语境的时候会用hi
